Process Execution Steps:
Step 1 : Open UBUNTU and locate and open ns-allinone-3.28 folder on Desktop.
Step 2 : Go to ns-3.28 folder and open examples->tutorial->first.cc
Step 3 : In first.cc , include the following code. (Before – “Simulator::Run ();”)
		#include “ns3/netanim-module.h”
		AnimationInterface anim(“first, xml”);
		AsciiTraceHelper ascii;
		pointToPoint.EnableAsciiAll(ascii.CreateFileStream(“first.tr”));
		pointToPoint.EnablePcapAll(“first”);
Step 4 : Copy first.cc and paste it in ns-3.28->scratch folder. Remember that scratch folder should contain only one .cc example file and it must contain scratch executable file named scratchsimulator.cc and other files can be deleted.
Step 5 : Open terminal and change working directory to Desktop by cd Desktop and type following commands to go to location where scratch executable file is located i.e. scratch folder.
Step 6 : cd ns-allinone-3.28
Step 7 : cd ns-3.28
Step 8 : Run the first.cc by entering following command.
	./waf –run scratch/first
Step 9 : Once build is successful, return to ns-allinone-3.28 folder with cd ../ and enter into netanim3.108 with cd netanim-3.108
Step 10 : Now to see the animation, we have to open NetAnim software. So open by entering
./NetAnim on terminal.
